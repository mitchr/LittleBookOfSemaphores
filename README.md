# LittleBookOfSemaphores
LaTeX source and supporting code for The Little Book of Semaphores, by Allen Downey.

# Changes made
This version is formatted to fit the standard pocket book size of `4.25inx6.875in` (after all, this is the _Little_ Book of Semaphores). I've had to make some pretty heinous changes to the text to get it all to fit, including making the TOC smaller and renaming some of the code snippet variables to be shorter, but I think it is still readable.

The largest change is the omission of the blank pages after each puzzle and hint that allowed the reader to write some notes and solve the problem for themselves. A more skilled LaTeXer could probably have kept everything working but it was too annoying for me (I'm working on it though!).
